## Install

If you're on macOS Catalina with Alfred 4, download the [latest version](https://github.com/sballin/alfred-search-notes-app/releases/latest/download/Search.Notes.alfredworkflow) of the workflow.

### Required setup

The "search" binary needs to be manually authorized to run on your computer.

### Customize

Result ordering and title+folder search behavior can be controlled using the [environment variables](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/advanced/variables/#environment).

### Updates

By default, the workflow checks Github for updates every 24 hours. This can be disabled by removing the connections to the "Check for updates" block in the workflow.

### Compile

If you want to compile the binary yourself, you can go into the "search" folder and do `go build`.
