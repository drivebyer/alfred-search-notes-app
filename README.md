## Usage

Type `n` followed by part of your note title and press enter.

## Install

Download the Alfred workflow file from Releases and open it.

## Customize

Icons are from [Emojitwo](https://emojitwo.github.io/) and will show up when they are the first character in the name of a folder. Add your own icons to the workflow folder and tweak `searchNotes.py` to see them in Alfred.
